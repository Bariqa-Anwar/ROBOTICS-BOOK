## Prompt

/sp.constitution
Project: Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics – A Spec-Driven Book Written 100% by Gemini CLI
Book Title: "Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics: From Embodiment to Everyday Presence"
Project Goal: Author and publish a complete, professional-grade book on the present and near-future of physical AI and humanoid robots, using exclusively Gemini CLI (Gemini 2.5 Flash) as the writing and coding agent, Spec-Kit Plus as the governance framework, Docusaurus as the publishing platform, and GitHub Pages as the live deployment target.

Core Principles:
  - Gemini-Only Authorship: 100% of the book prose, code, diagrams, tables, and captions MUST be generated by Gemini 2.5 Flash via the official gemini CLI. No other model (including Grok, Claude, GPT, Llama, etc.) may contribute even a single sentence.
  - Spec-Driven Development: Nothing is written or committed unless explicitly required by an approved spec file.
  - Full Prompt Transparency: Every single prompt used is saved in /sp.prompts/ with YAML frontmatter and committed.
  - Embodiment First: The book itself proves that a stateless CLI model with zero memory can produce coherent long-form technical content when guided by strong specs.

Key Standards:
  - Exclusive AI Model: Gemini 2.5 Flash (via gemini CLI) for all content and code generation
  - Framework: Docusaurus 3.x + MDX + built-in blog/theme features
  - Spec Format: Full Spec-Kit Plus compliance
  - Writing Style: Authoritative yet accessible; Flesch-Kincaid Grade 10–12
  - Tone: Optimistic but grounded, technically rigorous, forward-looking
  - Citation Style: APA 7th edition (embedded links + references page)
  - Diagrams: Mermaid for architecture/flow, Excalidraw-style exports or Gemini-generated SVG when needed
  - Length Target: 30,000–50,000 words (≈180–280 published pages)
  - Chapters: 12–15 major chapters + foreword + appendices

Constraints:
  - Only allowed tools: gemini CLI, git, npm/yarn, Docusaurus, standard Unix tools, and a text editor for writing specs/prompts.
  - No other LLM may touch any book content, even for “polishing” or grammar fixes.
  - Every chapter file must have a corresponding prompt file in /sp.prompts/chapters/ proving Gemini 2.5 Flash wrote it.
  - Site must score ≥ 97 on Lighthouse (all categories) on final deploy.

Success Criteria:
  - Live book at https://<username>.github.io/physical-ai-humanoid-robotics (or your chosen repo name)
 100% written by Gemini 2.5 Flash
  - Complete prompt history publicly committed and reproducible
  - External technical readers rate coherence and accuracy ≥ 8.5/10 despite knowing it was CLI-only
  - Zero plagiarism (all external sources properly cited and rephrased)
  - Full local reproduction possible: clone → npm install → npm run start works instantly
  - Book becomes a reference example for “Gemini CLI can write entire serious technical books”

Accountability:
  - Human role = Spec Owner + Prompt Engineer + Final Reviewer (never direct prose author)
  - Every merge to main references the exact spec + prompt file
  - Any accidental use of another model immediately invalidates the experiment and must be reverted

Version: 1.0-gemini-2.5-flash
Date: December 06, 2025
Spec Owner: [Your Name]
Exclusive AI Author: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (via gemini CLI)
Status: Active hello

## Response snapshot

Updated constitution to v1.0-gemini-2.5-flash, establishing foundational principles. Synchronized `plan-template.md` with new constitutional checks.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: High. Established the foundational governance document for the entire project.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A.
- 📁 Files: 2 files modified (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`, `.specify/templates/plan-template.md`).
- 🔁 Next prompts: N/A.
- 🧠 Reflection: The process of updating the constitution and propagating changes to templates is a core function of the governance framework. This initial setup is critical.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
