## Appendix B : $700 Jetson Student Kit Build Guide

### Introduction : Affordable Edge AI for Robotics

Throughout this book, we've demonstrated the power of the NVIDIA Jetson platform for hardware-accelerated AI and robotics. However, a full-fledged humanoid robot can be an expensive endeavor. This appendix provides a practical guide for building an affordable, yet highly capable, **$700 Jetson Student Kit**. This kit will serve as an excellent platform for prototyping, learning, and deploying the perception and control pipelines developed in this book.

Our goal is to create a complete, functional setup for under $700 (prices may vary based on region and sales), allowing you to experiment with ROS 2, Isaac ROS, and advanced AI models on real hardware.

### B.2 Assembly Instructions

The Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit requires minimal assembly.

1.  **Insert microSD Card :** With the Jetson powered off, carefully insert the flashed microSD card (from the flashing guide in Chapter 16) into the slot on the underside of the Orin Nano module.
2.  **Connect Peripherals :**
    *   Plug the USB Keyboard and Mouse into the USB 3.0 Hub.
    *   Plug the RealSense D435i into the USB 3.0 Hub.
    *   Plug the USB 3.0 Hub into one of the USB 3.0 ports on the Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit.
    *   Connect the HDMI cable from the Jetson to your monitor.
    *   Connect the Ethernet cable from the Jetson to your router/PC (optional, but recommended for network stability).
3.  **Connect Power :** Plug the 5V/4A DC Power Supply into the USB-C power port on the Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit. The system should boot up automatically.

### B.3 Software Setup (JetPack, ROS 2, Isaac ROS)

This section summarizes the software setup, referencing the detailed instructions from Chapter 16.

1.  **Flash JetPack :** Perform a clean flash of the Jetson Orin Nano with the latest **JetPack** using NVIDIA SDK Manager. Follow the instructions in Chapter 16, Part 1. This installs the Ubuntu OS, NVIDIA drivers, CUDA, cuDNN, TensorRT, and other essential libraries.
2.  **Initial OS Configuration :** Complete the Ubuntu setup wizard on the Jetson itself.
3.  **Install ROS 2 Humble :** Follow the official ROS 2 documentation for installing ROS 2 Humble (desktop version) on Ubuntu 20.04 (JetPack 5.x is based on Ubuntu 20.04).
    ```bash
    # Set locale (if not already done)
    sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
    sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
    export LANG=en_US.UTF-8

    # Setup sources
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl gnupg lsb-release
    sudo curl -sSL https ://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg
    echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http ://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(source /etc/os-release && echo UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null

    # Install ROS 2 desktop
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade
    sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop

    # Environment setup
    echo "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```
4.  **Install Docker :** (As detailed in Chapter 16)
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install docker.io
    sudo systemctl enable --now docker
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    # You will need to log out and log back in for docker group changes to take effect
    ```
5.  **Pull Isaac ROS Development Container :**
    ```bash
    # Log in to NVIDIA Container Registry if needed (refer to Isaac ROS docs)
    # docker login nvcr.io
    docker pull nvcr.io/isaac/isaac-ros-dev-jetson :latest
    ```
6.  **Create and Populate ROS 2 Workspace :**
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
    # Copy your project's ROS 2 packages (e.g., humanoid_core_pkg, my_robot_bringup) into ~/ros2_ws/src
    cd ~/ros2_ws
    colcon build
    source install/setup.bash
    ```

### B.4 Basic Smoke Test : RealSense & VSLAM

Let's perform a quick test to ensure your hardware is set up correctly and our Isaac ROS VSLAM pipeline can run.

1.  **Launch RealSense Driver :** Inside your Isaac ROS Docker container :
    ```bash
    ros2 launch realsense2_camera rs_launch.py enable_imu :=true enable_infra1 :=true enable_infra2 :=true
    ```
    You should see output indicating the RealSense driver is running and publishing topics like `/camera/color/image_raw`, `/camera/depth/image_rect_raw`, and `/camera/imu`.

2.  **Launch VSLAM Pipeline :** In a new terminal (inside the same Docker container) :
    ```bash
    ros2 launch isaac_ros_vslam isaac_ros_vslam_isaac_ros_d435.launch.py
    ```
    This launch file is typically provided by the `isaac_ros_vslam` package and configured for a RealSense D435i. It will start the VSLAM node and expect the RealSense topics. If successful, VSLAM will start outputting odometry.

3.  **Visualize with RViz (from Host PC) :** From your powerful development PC (not the Jetson, and not in the Docker container), source your ROS 2 environment and run RViz :
    ```bash
    rviz2
    ```
    Add a `TF` display and you should see the `map` -> `odom` transform published by VSLAM. As you move the RealSense camera around, the robot's pose in RViz should update. You can also add `Image` displays for the camera feeds and a `PointCloud2` display for VSLAM's feature cloud.

        I --> VSLAM;
    end
    subgraph "Host PC"
        RViz[RViz2] --> O;
    end
    O -- Network (ROS 2) --> RViz;
    style RS_Drv fill :#aaffaa

    style RViz fill :#aaaaff
`} />
