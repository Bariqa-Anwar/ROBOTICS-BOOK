**Weeks 6–7** • **7,500–9,000 words**

### Why this module exists
Before a humanoid walks in the real world, it must walk millions of steps in perfect simulation. This module teaches you how to build physics-accurate digital twins and high-fidelity visual environments—the foundation for all modern robotics training.

### Learning Outcomes
- Simulate gravity, friction, collisions, and sensor noise at real-time speeds
- Model LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs, and force/torque sensors with ground truth
- Bridge Gazebo physics with Unity’s rendering engine
- Export scenes that are 100% compatible with NVIDIA Isaac Sim

### Chapters in this module
1. **Chapter 06** – Gazebo Ignition: Physics, Plugins, Sensor Simulation  
2. **Chapter 07** – Unity Robotics Hub + Photorealistic Visualization  
3. **Chapter 08** – Realistic Indoor Environments & Sensor Noise Modeling

### Final Deliverable by Week 7
A complete apartment environment that runs in **both** Gazebo (physics-accurate) and Unity (human-beautiful), with perfectly synchronized ROS 2 topics for every sensor.
