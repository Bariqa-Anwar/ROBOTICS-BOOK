**Weeks 3–5** • **9,000–11,000 words** • **Core skill: ROS 2 mastery**

### Why this module exists
Every humanoid robot—whether simulated or real—needs a rock-solid nervous system. ROS 2 is the industry-standard middleware that connects perception, planning, and actuation. By the end of this module you will be able to build, from scratch, a complete ROS 2 workspace that fully controls a 22+ DoF humanoid robot.

### Learning Outcomes
- Master ROS 2 core concepts (nodes, topics, services, actions, parameters)
- Write production-grade Python (rclpy) packages that run on both x86 workstations and ARM64 Jetson
- Model complex humanoids using URDF + Xacro (including transmission, gazebo plugins, and mimic joints)
- Launch multi-node systems with perfect launch files and parameter tuning

### Chapters in this module
1. **Chapter 03** – ROS 2 Architecture Deep Dive  
2. **Chapter 04** – Building Your First Humanoid ROS 2 Package (Python + rclpy)  
3. **Chapter 05** – URDF & Xacro Mastery – From Stick Figure to Full Humanoid

### Final Deliverable by Week 5
A fully functional ROS 2 workspace containing:
- A complete 22-DoF humanoid URDF with sensors and actuators
- Publisher/subscriber nodes for joint states and commands
- Action server for high-level tasks (e.g., “wave hand”)
- One-click `colcon build && ros2 launch` that brings the robot to life

<Highlight>After this module, Gemini 2.5 Flash will be able to send commands directly into your robot’s nervous system.</Highlight>
