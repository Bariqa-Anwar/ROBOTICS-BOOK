**Weeks 8–10** • **11,000–13,000 words** • **The hardest and most valuable module**

### Why this module exists
NVIDIA Isaac is the only platform that combines photorealistic simulation, hardware-accelerated perception, and sim-to-real transfer at scale. This is where your humanoid becomes truly intelligent.

### Learning Outcomes
- Generate millions of synthetic training images with perfect labels
- Run CUDA-accelerated VSLAM and manipulation stacks on Jetson
- Achieve stable bipedal walking using pretrained policies + domain randomization
- Close the sim-to-real gap to <15 cm localization error

### Chapters in this module
1. **Chapter 09** – Isaac Sim: Domain Randomization & Synthetic Data at Scale  
2. **Chapter 10** – Isaac ROS: VSLAM, Nav2, Perception Pipelines on Jetson  
3. **Chapter 11** – Bipedal Locomotion, ZMP, Whole-Body Control

### Final Deliverable by Week 10
A simulated humanoid that can walk 50+ meters through a cluttered apartment without falling—and the exact recipe to deploy the same perception stack to real hardware.
