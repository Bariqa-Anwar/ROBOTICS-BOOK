# Implementation Plan: Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Book

**Branch**: `1-physical-ai-book` | **Date**: 2025-12-07 | **Spec**: E:\humanoid-robotics\specs\1-physical-ai-book\spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `E:\humanoid-robotics\specs\1-physical-ai-book\spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This plan outlines the roadmap, architecture, research strategy, quality gates, and phased timeline for authoring and publishing the "Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics" book. The book will be 100% generated by Gemini 2.5 Flash via the `gemini` CLI, following a spec-driven development approach, and published as a Docusaurus 3.x website to GitHub Pages. The primary goal is to provide a professional-grade technical resource for university students (simulated humanoid capstone project) and researchers, while demonstrating Gemini's capability to produce coherent, reproducible long-form technical content.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.10+ (for ROS 2 and simulation scripts), PowerShell (for automation scripts), Markdown/MDX (for book content)
**Primary Dependencies**: ROS 2 Humble (LTS), NVIDIA Isaac Sim 2023.1.1+, Docusaurus 3.x, Git, `gemini` CLI
**Storage**: Git repository for all content, prompts, and code; GitHub Pages for deployed website.
**Testing**: `pytest` for Python code, `npm run check-links` for Docusaurus links, GitHub Actions for CI/CD, manual verification for content quality (human review).
**Target Platform**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (for development, testing, and simulation environment), Web browser (for Docusaurus site).
**Project Type**: Book (static website)
**Performance Goals**: Docusaurus site Lighthouse score ≥ 97 across all categories. Content generation performance is secondary to quality and reproducibility.
**Constraints**: 100% Gemini 2.5 Flash authorship, strict Spec-Kit Plus compliance, APA 7th edition citations, Mermaid/Gemini-generated SVG diagrams, 45,000–60,000 word count. Simulation-first approach for core content (real hardware optional).
**Scale/Scope**: 14 chapters, 4 appendices, 80+ citations. Single book project.
**Key Decisions Already Locked (from Spec)**: Simulation-first capstone (real hardware = optional bonus), Gemini 2.5 Flash = sole author, APA 7th edition citations, Diagrams = Mermaid only (theme #00ff9d), All code tested on ROS 2 Humble + Isaac Sim 2023.1.1+.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

-   [x] **Gemini-Only Authorship**: Does the proposed plan rely exclusively on Gemini 2.5 Flash for all content and code generation? - *Yes, explicitly stated in the plan and core to the project goal.*
-   [x] **Spec-Driven Development**: Does every proposed task trace back to a requirement in the `spec.md` file? - *Yes, all major phases and outputs are linked to spec requirements.*
-   [x] **Full Prompt Transparency**: Does the plan account for saving all prompts to `history/prompts/`? - *Yes, the plan includes `history/prompts/` for version control of prompts.*
-   [x] **Embodiment First**: Does the plan reinforce the goal of demonstrating the CLI-driven process, rather than taking shortcuts? - *Yes, the phased timeline and quality validation emphasize the process and reproducibility.*
-   [x] **Standards Adherence**: Does the plan respect the key standards (Docusaurus, MDX, APA 7th, etc.)? - *Yes, all key standards from the Constitution are integrated into the plan's technical context and constraints.*

```

**Structure Decision**: The project will utilize a Docusaurus 3.x static site generator. Book chapters will reside in the `book/` directory, organized by module. General documentation and static assets will be in the `docs/` and `static/img/` directories respectively. All Gemini CLI prompts will be version-controlled in `history/prompts/`. GitHub Actions will handle CI/CD for code testing and site deployment.
