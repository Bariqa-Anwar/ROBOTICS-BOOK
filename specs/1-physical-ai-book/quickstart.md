# Quickstart Guide for "Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Book"

This guide provides a quick overview of how to set up, build, and run the "Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Book" project locally.

## 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

-   **Git**: For cloning the repository.
-   **Node.js** (LTS version): Required for Docusaurus.
-   **npm** or **Yarn**: Node.js package manager (npm comes with Node.js).
-   **Python 3.10+**: For executing code snippets (ROS 2, simulation).
-   **PowerShell**: For running project scripts (e.g., `setup-plan.ps1`).

## 2. Get the Code

Clone the book's repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/humanoid-robotics.git # Replace with actual repo URL
cd humanoid-robotics
```

## 3. Install Docusaurus Dependencies

Navigate to the `book/` directory and install the necessary dependencies for the Docusaurus website:

```bash
cd book
npm install # or yarn install
```

## 4. Run the Docusaurus Site Locally

After installing dependencies, you can start the local development server:

```bash
npm start # or yarn start
```

This will open the book website in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:3000`. Any changes you make to the markdown files in the `book/` directory will automatically refresh the browser.

## 5. Regenerate Content (High-Level)

The book content is 100% generated by the Gemini CLI. To regenerate content for a specific chapter (e.g., Chapter 03), you would typically:

1.  Ensure you have the `gemini` CLI installed and configured.
2.  Locate the relevant prompt file in `history/prompts/` (e.g., `history/prompts/03-ros2-architecture.prompt.md`).
3.  Use the `gemini` CLI with the prompt to generate the chapter content. The exact command will be provided within the project's documentation for each chapter.

    *(Example, specific command will vary)*
    ```bash
    # This is a placeholder example command
    gemini generate --prompt history/prompts/03-ros2-architecture.prompt.md --output book/01-ros2/ch03-ros2-architecture.mdx
    ```

This quickstart gets you up and running with the Docusaurus development environment. For detailed development and content generation workflows, refer to the project's `plan.md` and `tasks.md` files.
