# AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics (Docusaurus) Constitution
>>>>>>> ae898bc (first commit)

# Constitution of "Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics"

<<<<<<< HEAD
- **Project Name**: Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics – A Spec-Driven Book Written 100% by Gemini CLI
- **Project Goal**: Author and publish a complete, professional-grade book on the present and near-future of physical AI and humanoid robots, using exclusively Gemini CLI (Gemini 2.5 Flash) as the writing and coding agent, Spec-Kit Plus as the governance framework, Docusaurus as the publishing platform, and GitHub Pages as the live deployment target.

## 1. Governance

- **Constitution Version**: 1.0-gemini-2.5-flash
- **Ratification Date**: 2025-12-06
- **Last Amended Date**: 2025-12-06
- **Status**: Active
- **Spec Owner**: TODO(OWNER_NAME): [Your Name]
- **Exclusive AI Author**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (via gemini CLI)

This document is the single source of truth for project principles, standards, and governance. Amendments require a new version bump following semantic versioning rules and must be documented in a commit message.

## 2. Core Principles

These are the non-negotiable laws of the project.

### Principle 1: Gemini-Only Authorship

**100% of the book prose, code, diagrams, tables, and captions MUST be generated by Gemini 2.5 Flash via the official gemini CLI.** No other model (including Grok, Claude, GPT, Llama, etc.) may contribute even a single sentence.

*Rationale: The project's primary goal is to test and showcase the capabilities of a specific AI model operating via a stateless CLI. Any external contribution invalidates this core experiment.*

### Principle 2: Spec-Driven Development

**Nothing is written or committed unless explicitly required by an approved spec file.** All work must trace back to a specific, version-controlled requirement.

*Rationale: This ensures a rigorous, auditable, and repeatable workflow, which is critical for demonstrating that the AI can follow a plan to produce a complex artifact without continuous interactive guidance.*

### Principle 3: Full Prompt Transparency

**Every single prompt used is saved in `history/prompts/` with YAML frontmatter and committed.** The history must be complete and allow for the reproduction of any part of the book.

*Rationale: Transparency is essential for verifying the "Gemini-Only Authorship" principle and for allowing others to study the human-AI interaction patterns that led to the final product.*

### Principle 4: Embodiment First

**The book itself proves that a stateless CLI model with zero memory can produce coherent long-form technical content when guided by strong specs.** The process is the product.

*Rationale: This principle reminds us that the primary artifact is not just the book, but the demonstration of the entire spec-driven, CLI-based authoring process.*

## 3. Key Standards

- **Exclusive AI Model**: Gemini 2.5 Flash (via gemini CLI) for all content and code generation.
- **Framework**: Docusaurus 3.x + MDX + built-in blog/theme features.
- **Spec Format**: Full Spec-Kit Plus compliance.
- **Writing Style**: Authoritative yet accessible; Flesch-Kincaid Grade 10–12.
- **Tone**: Optimistic but grounded, technically rigorous, forward-looking.
- **Citation Style**: APA 7th edition (embedded links + references page).
- **Diagrams**: Mermaid for architecture/flow; Gemini-generated SVG for other illustrations.
- **Length Target**: 30,000–50,000 words (≈180–280 published pages).
- **Chapters**: 12–15 major chapters + foreword + appendices.

## 4. Constraints

- **Tooling**: Only the `gemini` CLI, `git`, `npm`/`yarn`, Docusaurus CLI, standard Unix/PowerShell tools, and a text editor for specs/prompts are permitted.
- **AI Purity**: No other LLM may touch any book content, even for "polishing" or grammar fixes.
- **Traceability**: Every chapter file must have a corresponding prompt file in `history/prompts/` proving Gemini 2.5 Flash wrote it.
- **Performance**: The final deployed site must score ≥ 97 on all Lighthouse categories.

## 5. Success Criteria

- **Publication**: The book is live and publicly accessible at `https://<username>.github.io/humanoid-robotics` (or the chosen repository name).
- **Authorship Verification**: The book is verifiably 100% written by Gemini 2.5 Flash.
- **Reproducibility**: The complete prompt history is publicly committed and allows for external verification.
- **Quality**: External technical readers rate the book's coherence and accuracy ≥ 8.5/10, despite knowing its origin.
- **Originality**: The book passes plagiarism checks, with all external sources properly cited and rephrased.
- **Build Integrity**: The repository can be cloned and run locally (`npm install && npm run start`) without errors.
- **Legacy**: The project serves as a reference example for AI-driven, long-form technical authoring.

## 6. Accountability

- **Roles**: The human role is strictly defined as Spec Owner, Prompt Engineer, and Final Reviewer. The human is never a direct prose author.
- **Commits**: Every merge to the `main` branch must reference the exact spec and prompt file(s) that justify the change.
- **Integrity Protocol**: Any accidental use of another model immediately invalidates the experiment and the offending commits must be reverted.
=======
### I. Technical Accuracy
All content, code snippets, and hardware specifications must be factually correct and aligned with the official documentation for ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, and Docusaurus.

### II. Step-by-Step Pedagogy
The content must be structured to facilitate student learning, moving from core concepts to practical implementation, as detailed in the four modules.

### III. Consistency
Maintain a consistent professional/academic tone suitable for a university-level capstone course. Use standardized terminology (e.g., always use 'ROS 2' not 'ROS 2.0').

## Key Standards

- **Output Format**: All content must be in clean, valid *Markdown (MDX)* syntax, ready for direct inclusion into a Docusaurus documentation structure.
- **Structure Mandate**: The book must adhere strictly to the user-provided structure: [Introduction/Setup] -> [Module 1] -> [Module 2] -> [Module 3] -> [Module 4].
- **Chapter Granularity**: Each Module must be broken down into logically sequenced chapters with high-level, detailed, and accurate content (as demonstrated in the Chapter 1 reference).
- **Code Integrity**: All code examples (e.g., Python rclpy nodes, URDF snippets) must be complete, syntactically correct, and use appropriate Markdown code blocks with language highlighting.
- **Visualization Tagging**: For complex concepts (e.g., ROS 2 computation graph, URDF structure, Sim-to-Real workflow), embed *Diagram Tags* for instructional value.

## Constraints and Success Criteria

### Constraints
- **Technology Stack**: Content generation must focus exclusively on: *ROS 2 Humble/Iron, **Python 3.10+ (rclpy), **Gazebo, **Unity (for visualization/HRI), **NVIDIA Isaac Sim/ROS, and **LLM/VLA integration (OpenAI Whisper/GPT)*.
- **Exclusion**: Do NOT include content on the legacy *ROS 1* platform, except for brief explanatory context on why ROS 2 is superior, if necessary.
- **Deployment**: All final content must be compatible with Docusaurus and deployment to GitHub Pages (e.g., no external file dependencies outside of the defined project structure).

### Success Criteria
- The generated Docusaurus Markdown files align perfectly with the required Module/Chapter hierarchy.
- Content is technically accurate and complete for all core concepts in the *Weekly Breakdown*.
- Visualization tags are strategically placed to enhance understanding of complex systems.

## Governance
This Constitution defines the core principles and operational guidelines for the project. All work, including design, development, and documentation, must adhere to these tenets. Any proposed amendments to this Constitution must be formally documented, approved by the project leads, and include a clear migration plan for existing work. Compliance with these rules will be regularly reviewed, and significant deviations will require immediate corrective action.

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-12-10 | **Last Amended**: 2025-12-10
